### Abstract
TODO Rewrite all the document

The goal of this project was to use linear regression to predict the overall rating of footballers in FIFA 22. We worked with the data we scraped from https://www.fifaindex.com/ , Leveraging TODO feature engineering? along with linear regression to achieve promising results for this problem.


### Design

This project originated from our passion for football. The data is provided by our web scrapper. We used the data from fifindex.com to build our model that'll be able to predict future players overall rating. After that, TODO: add something?

### Data

FIFA 22 dataset contains 18,000 players (data points) and we selected 40 features for each pplayer. A few feature highlights include Height, Weight, Age, Wage, Preferred Foot, and Overall Rating.


### Algorithms

#ask Faisal and edit
1.  Performed data cleaning.
2.  Visualized the data and removed outliers.
3.  Aggregated the data by station and ordered by Highest Traffic.
4.  Plotted New York Map with the Percentage of people taking public transportation.
5.  Located each of the top 5 stations and took a 1-squre mile demographic data around it.

### Tools

-   Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
-   Seaborn for plotting.
-   Selenium for beb scrapping.
-   Google Chrome for web scrapping.
-   Scikit-learn for modeling.


### Communication

In addition to the slides and the visuals included in the presentation, we will submit our code and proposal.
