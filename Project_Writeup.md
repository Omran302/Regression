### Abstract
TODO Rewrite all the document


The goal of this project was to use Exploratory Data Analysis to determine the demographic in 1-squre mile around the top 5 busiest station in New York in order to help our clients reach their marking targeted demographic. We worked with data provided by NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority and The United States Census Bureau to obtain New York city Demographic Data, leveraging data cleaning along with graphs to meet our clients needs while also providing data to back up our findings. After concluding our analysis, We prepared a presentation and plotted our findings to highlight which station is the best fit for each of our clients.

### Design

This project originated from our clients needs to increase their sales. The data is provided by NYC MTA traffic data and the U.S Census Bureau (Specifically NYC Demographic Data). Our team uses NYC MTA data to locate the top 5 busiest stations in NYC in order to have an idea of each station's demographic. After that, our team used the results of our analysis to determine which station would be most suitable for each client.

### Data

The NYC MTA dataset contains 8,375,005 traffic reading with 14 features for each reading. A few feature highlights include Date, Time(4 hour increments for each day which represent a single traffic reading per turnstile), Station name, Entries and Exits. While NYC demographic dataset contains 2,167 rows a with 28 features where each row represent a Census Tract.

### Algorithms

1.  Performed data cleaning.
2.  Visualized the data and removed outliers.
3.  Aggregated the data by station and ordered by Highest Traffic.
4.  Plotted New York Map with the Percentage of people taking public transportation.
5.  Located each of the top 5 stations and took a 1-squre mile demographic data around it.

### Tools

-   Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
-   Matplotlib for plotting.

### Communication

Our team will deliver a written description of the project summraizing our work in addition to the slides and the visuals included in the presentation.
